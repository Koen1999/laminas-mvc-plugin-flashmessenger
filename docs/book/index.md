## Installation

Install via composer:

```bash
$ composer require laminas/laminas-mvc-plugin-flashmessenger
```

If you are using the [laminas-component-installer](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-component-installer/),
you're done!

If not, you will need to add the component as a module to your
application. Add the entry `'Laminas\Mvc\Plugin\FlashMessenger'` to
your list of modules in your application configuration (typically
one of `config/application.config.php` or `config/modules.config.php`).
