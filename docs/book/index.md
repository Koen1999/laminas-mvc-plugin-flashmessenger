## Installation

Install via composer:

```bash
$ composer require zendframework/zend-mvc-plugin-flashmessenger
```

If you are using the [zend-component-installer](https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-component-installer/),
you're done!

If not, you will need to add the component as a module to your
application. Add the entry `'Zend\Mvc\Plugin\FlashMessenger'` to
your list of modules in your application configuration (typically
one of `config/application.config.php` or `config/modules.config.php`).
